When I discovered the headphone jack problem, my left earbud was not working. I tried several pairs of headphones to find that the jack was the problem. I looked up possible ways to solve the problem only to find that I would have to replace the whole lower part of the phone. Secondly, the phone began acting funky yesterday. The phone had been charging for a while and when I checked it, it only said it had been charged up to 8%. I had to turn off my phone and turn it back on to find it was at 40%. And right now it will not charge. It told me that my charger was not a supported accessory. The phone has been plugged in all night and still hasn't charged. I have not tried a different charger yet, but I shouldn't have to. This was a waste of money. I do not blame Apple, because I've bought from them directly before and it was wonderful, but I would not recommend buying from this seller. If you want and IPhone just save up your money and buy directly from Apple. It's worth it.\n",

I took it to a authorized Apple repair station, and was told the screen had been replaced with a aftermarket screen. (explains why the fingerprint function does not work).
